# 📖 Story: The House That Slept With Its Doors Open  

**Question 05**

In the kingdom of **SecureNet Horizons**, the architects of defense were raising digital walls to guard their Azure skies.  
But one apprentice, curious and hopeful, asked:  

> “Do we really need to live as if enemies are already inside?  
> Must we always **Assume Breach**?”

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Characters  

- **Elder Kareem**: The master architect of defense, seasoned by storms.  
- **Lina, the Young Designer**: Brave, but still learning the hidden patterns of attackers.  
- **ShadowNet, the Silent Invader**: Thrives on blind spots and forgotten assumptions.

## 🗣 Dialogue  

Lina whispered:  
> “Surely if our walls are strong, we can rest easy?”  

Elder Kareem shook his head gently:  
> “Child, walls may stand tall, but shadows slip through cracks.  
> To protect the realm, we must **assume breach** —  
> watch every corner, monitor every gate,  
> and prepare as if danger already walks among us.”  

From the silence, ShadowNet chuckled:  
> “If they stop assuming, I will sleep inside their house,  
> unseen,  
> feeding on their trust until fire spreads in secret.”  

Lina’s eyes widened with understanding.  
Preparation was not paranoia — it was wisdom.

## 🌟 Truth Revealed  

The **Zero Trust model** rests on three living principles:  
- **Verify Explicitly** — check all requests, always.  
- **Use Least Privilege Access** — grant only what’s needed.  
- **Assume Breach** — act as if compromise has already happened, so response is instant.  

Without *Assume Breach*, defenders grow blind. With it, vigilance never sleeps.

## 🌹 Lesson  

**Zero Trust does not wait for proof of fire — it lives ready, as if the flames already exist. Preparation is the true shield of defense.**
