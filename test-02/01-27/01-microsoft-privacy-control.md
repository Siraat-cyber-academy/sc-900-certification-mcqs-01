# 📖 Story: The Lantern of Control  

**Question 01**

Once upon a time, there was a thriving town called **CloudNova**.  
The townsfolk were preparing to entrust their valuable records and secrets to the skies — to **Azure Cloud Services**.  

But before making this leap, the council of leaders paused with a question:  

> "Is *Control* truly one of the guiding principles of privacy,  
> or is security alone enough to protect what we hold dear?"

## 🗣 Dialogue  

Hamza asked softly:  
> "Lady Safiya, is Control really that important?  
> Isn’t security by itself enough?"  

Safiya lit a lantern and replied:  
> "My son, if the lantern is not in your hand,  
> who decides where the light should fall?  
> Control is the lantern —  
> it empowers you to choose how your secrets are shared,  
> and how your story is told."  

From the shadows came a sinister whisper:  
> "If you surrender control,  
> I will quietly rewrite your choices.  
> You will believe you are free,  
> but I will pull the strings from the dark."  

Hamza shivered, but Safiya’s smile restored his courage.

## 🌟 Truth Revealed  

Microsoft’s privacy principles indeed include *Control*.  
Without it, privacy collapses.

- They hold the right to stop, restrict, or allow.  
- No system should override the individual’s authority.

## 🌹 Lesson  

**Privacy is a lantern — and Control is the oil that keeps it burning.  
Without Control, the light of trust fades.**
