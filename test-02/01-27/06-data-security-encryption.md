## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Encryption is the cloak of secrecy, a shield of light. Only those with the right key can unveil the hidden truth within."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, encryption ensures **confidentiality** by transforming readable data into ciphertext. Only authorized users with the decryption key can access the original data."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Deduplication, archiving, and compression are useful storage methods but do not secure data against attackers. Encryption alone enforces access control at the data level."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of encryption like writing your diary in a secret code. Deduplication, archiving, and compression just organize your bookshelf — but only the code keeps secrets safe!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"Without encryption, sensitive human information is exposed. Encryption safeguards personal and business trust."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I used to think compression protected files. Now I get it — only encryption ensures that outsiders can’t read private data."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If InfoGuard forgets encryption, I’ll read their data in plain text — no locks, no barriers, only secrets spilled."
