# 🔐 Cybersecurity Story

**Question 06**

## 🌍 Scenario  
At **InfoGuard Technologies**, the IT team was worried. Their sensitive business data had moved into **Azure Cloud Services**, but a troubling question echoed through the glass-walled office in Copenhagen:  

*"How do we ensure only the right people can read our data — while keeping everyone else out?"*  

And so began a roundtable of voices, gathered not just from one place, but from across the world. 🌍

## 🌐 The Story Unfolds  

🇦🇺 **Liam Carter (Australia – The Analyst)** leaned forward, tapping his pen:  
*"We need a lock so strong that even if someone steals the box, they can’t see what’s inside. That lock is called **encryption**."*  

🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera (Spain – The Calm Guardian)** shook her head gently:  
*"I’ve heard people confuse it with deduplication — removing duplicates doesn’t protect secrets. It only saves storage."*  

🇧🇷 **Camila Torres (Brazil – The Empathic Voice)** added:  
*"Archiving? That’s for storing things long-term, like putting old letters in the attic. It doesn’t stop a thief from reading them if the attic door is open."*  

🇮🇳 **Arjun Mehta (India – The Rookie Explorer)** raised his hand timidly:  
*"Compression makes files smaller, but… if a hacker grabs the file, can’t they just unzip it? That’s no real protection."*  

The room fell silent.  

Then…  

🇵🇰 **I.K. (Pakistan – The Unseen Mentor)** spoke softly, like a sage:  
*"Encryption is the cloak of secrecy. Only the rightful holder of the key may see what lies beneath. Without it, your treasure is naked before the world."*  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova (Russia – The Cloud Whiz)** added technical weight:  
*"Exactly. Encryption converts plain text into unreadable ciphertext. Unless you have the decryption key, the data remains safe — even if intercepted."*  

From the shadows, a chilling whisper stirred.  

🕶️ **ShadowNet (The Phantom Adversary)** hissed:  
*"Forget encryption, and I will read your secrets in plain text. I will turn your trust into dust."*

## 🌟 Lesson  
👉 **Encryption is the unbreakable lock — guarding data so only authorized users can read it.**
