## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"The cloud divides the burden — the provider holds the foundation, but the customer must guard the keys to their doors: access, identities, and permissions."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, in SaaS like Microsoft 365, Microsoft manages infrastructure, servers, and availability. The customer is responsible for **identity, access management, and data classification**."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Many assume they’re free of all responsibility in SaaS. That’s a trap. If you ignore access controls, attackers will gladly exploit misconfigured identities."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it like renting an apartment. The landlord handles plumbing and electricity, but you still lock your doors and decide who gets a key!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"From the human angle, this reinforces accountability. Even in SaaS, organizations must take ownership of **who can access what**."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I first thought infrastructure was ours too — but now I see Microsoft handles that. We just control the access side."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If NextWave neglects access controls, I’ll slip inside using weak credentials. No firewall or redundancy will save them then."

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **In SaaS, Microsoft manages the platform — but customers must secure access and identities.**
