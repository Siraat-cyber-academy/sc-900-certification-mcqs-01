# 🔐 Cybersecurity Concept Notes  

**Question Number 16**

## 🌍 Scenario  
At **SkyShield Technologies**, the IT Manager, Aisha, is reviewing how to control traffic inside their Azure environment.  
The junior engineer, Daniel, asks:  

> “Can we use **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** to filter traffic not just broadly, but based on things like IP address, protocol, and port number?”  

This sparks a discussion in the team about the real power of NSGs.

## 📝 Concept Explained  

### 🔑 Key Idea  
Yes — NSGs can filter traffic at a very granular level using **rules based on source/destination IP, protocol (TCP/UDP), and port numbers**.  

### 🛠 How It Works  
1. **NSG as a firewall lite**: It acts like a mini-firewall at the subnet or NIC level.  
2. **Rules define flow**: Each rule specifies:  
   - Source IP or range  
   - Destination IP or range  
   - Protocol (TCP/UDP/Any)  
   - Port or port range  
   - Action (Allow/Deny)  
3. **Default rules**: Azure pre-creates rules that allow virtual network traffic and block all inbound from the internet.  
4. **Custom rules**: Admins add precise filters, e.g., allow TCP 443 from corporate IPs, deny all others.  

### ⚡ Real-World Application  
At SkyShield, Aisha configures rules:  
- Only corporate office IP ranges can access servers on **port 443 (HTTPS)**.  
- Deny all RDP (port 3389) traffic except from secure admin jumpbox.  
- Allow application servers to talk to SQL DB on port 1433, but block internet access for DB subnet.  

This ensures **least privilege network access** and reduces attack surface.  

### ⚠️ Common Misunderstandings  
- ❌ *“NSGs are like a full enterprise firewall”*: Not true, they are simpler, stateful filters.  
- ❌ *“NSGs can inspect traffic content”*: Wrong, they filter only by IP, port, protocol — not packet payload.  
- ❌ *“Outbound is always allowed”*: By default yes, but admins can block outbound using custom rules.

## 🌟 Lesson  
👉 **NSGs let you shape traffic with precision — controlling not just “who” talks, but also “how” (protocol/port) and “from where” (IP).**
