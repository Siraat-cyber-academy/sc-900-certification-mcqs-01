🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"From a technical standpoint, the **Zero Trust pillars** are built on the foundation of ‘Verify explicitly,’ ‘Use least privilege access,’ and ‘Assume breach.’ Verification is indeed an explicit principle."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"If you deny verification, you open doors for adversaries. Attackers love assumptions — Zero Trust removes them by verifying everything."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"Humans deserve the assurance that their digital identities are always checked. Verification ensures no one slips in unnoticed."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I thought Zero Trust was only about blocking access. But now I see: it’s about verifying every detail, no matter how small."
