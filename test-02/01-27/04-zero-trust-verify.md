# 📖 Story: The Gate of Verification  

**Question 04**

In the realm of **CyberTrust Dynamics**, the defenders of data were building new fortresses in the skies of Azure.  
Their leader asked the council:  

> “Must we truly *Verify* every request — is ‘Verify’ itself one of the sacred principles of Zero Trust?”  

The chamber fell quiet, as if awaiting the judgment of truth itself.

## 🗣 Dialogue  

Rahim spoke nervously:  
> “Surely we can trust those already inside… do we need to check them again?”  

Elder Amina’s eyes grew sharp:  
> “Rahim, in Zero Trust, *trust is never permanent*.  
> Every key, every badge, every identity must be **verified explicitly**.  
> For the moment we assume, we invite shadows in.”  

From the darkness, ShadowNet whispered with glee:  
> “Forget to verify me once… and I’ll wear your trusted faces, slip past your gates, and sit at your tables unseen.”  

Rahim shuddered, understanding at last.

## 🌟 Truth Revealed  

The **Zero Trust model** rests on three great pillars:  
- **Verify Explicitly** — check every request, every time, with all available signals.  
- **Use Least Privilege Access** — give only what is necessary, nothing more.  
- **Assume Breach** — prepare as if attackers are already inside.  

Yes — **Verification is not optional**. It is named as a principle itself.

## 🌹 Lesson  

**Zero Trust lives by a creed: Never assume, always verify.**
