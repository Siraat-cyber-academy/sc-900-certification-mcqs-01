## 📝 Options (Team Voices)

A. 🇩🇰 **Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
"Yes, NSGs can be configured with deny rules that block every inbound packet from the Internet."  

B. 🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
"No, NSGs are only designed to filter outbound traffic — inbound restrictions must be handled elsewhere."  

C. 🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"Yes, but it requires custom routing tables in addition to NSGs to fully enforce denial of inbound traffic."  

D. 🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"Not directly — NSGs can allow or deny based on ports, but completely blocking the Internet is handled by a firewall."

## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Like gates that close firmly against the storm, NSGs allow you to deny all inbound winds from the Internet. Only when you choose to open them does the breeze come through."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, NSGs operate at Layer 3 & 4, allowing admins to create rules for inbound and outbound traffic. Setting a blanket deny on inbound Internet traffic is fully possible."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Some may wrongly assume NSGs only manage outbound flows, or that you need firewalls. That’s the trap. NSGs are perfectly capable of denying inbound traffic."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it as a nightclub door: if you put a rule saying ‘nobody comes in,’ the bouncers (NSGs) will enforce it without hesitation."  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"From a user perspective, NSGs give IT peace of mind. They control not only what goes out but also what comes in, ensuring safety from unwanted connections."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I thought inbound traffic always needed a firewall. Now I see NSGs themselves can handle it with the right deny rules."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If admins forget to deny inbound traffic, I slip in unnoticed. NSGs are the locks; without them, the gates stand wide open."

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) can deny all inbound Internet traffic — they act as traffic filters at the network level.**
