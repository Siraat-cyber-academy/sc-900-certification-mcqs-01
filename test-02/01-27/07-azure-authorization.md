## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Authentication greets the traveler at the gate, but authorization decides which doors may open to them. It is the wisdom of access."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, **authentication = identity verification**, while **authorization = permission check**. In Azure, authorization ensures a signed-in user can perform the requested action on a resource."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"If you confuse authentication with authorization, attackers could slip in with valid identities but gain access beyond their rights. Authorization prevents privilege abuse."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it like a movie theater. Authentication is buying a ticket, but authorization is checking if that ticket is for the right screen!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"Authorization is about protecting people by ensuring only the right users can reach sensitive data or actions. It shields trust."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I used to mix these up — but now I see: authentication = who you are, authorization = what you’re allowed to do."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If CloudSphere mismanages authorization, I’ll escalate privileges quietly, moving from guest to admin without resistance."

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **Authentication proves identity, but authorization decides access — and in Azure, that’s the true gatekeeper.**
