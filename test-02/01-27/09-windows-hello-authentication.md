## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)  

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Windows Hello calls us away from the fading shadow of passwords, into the light of what we are — our face, our touch, our trusted PIN."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, Windows Hello for Business supports **PIN, facial recognition, and fingerprint biometrics**. Email and passwords belong to traditional methods and are not used as native authentication factors in Hello."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Passwords and emails sound familiar, but they’re weak against phishing and replay attacks. Hello was designed to kill these old risks."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it like entering a party. Passwords are paper tickets anyone can copy, email is like shouting your name through the door, but Hello gives you a unique face-scan or fingerprint wristband no one else can fake."  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"From the human side, biometrics free people from the stress of remembering complex passwords. Security becomes natural, personal, and empowering."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I almost thought ‘password’ because it’s everywhere — but Hello is all about moving beyond that into something safer."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If passwords or emails were still allowed, I would lurk with phishing campaigns and steal access. But biometrics and device PINs seal those cracks."
