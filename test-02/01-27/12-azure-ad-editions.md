## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"The truth lies not in sameness, but in the diversity of tiers. Each edition unfolds a different layer of capability."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, Azure AD editions differ: Free provides basics, P1 adds conditional access and hybrid identity, while P2 includes advanced security like Identity Protection and Privileged Identity Management."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"If one assumes all editions are equal, attackers rejoice — since missing features like PIM or risk-based conditional access mean weaker defense in some tiers."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"It’s like buying a car. The Free model is the base package, P1 adds some tech upgrades, and P2 gives you autopilot and luxury controls. Same car family, different power!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"For users, this matters — small teams may start with Free, but enterprises that need stronger security must step into P1 or P2."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I first thought ‘Yes’ because all editions say ‘Azure AD’ — but now I realize features like PIM aren’t in the Free tier."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If SkyNetics assumes all tiers protect equally, I’ll slip in where conditional access or Identity Protection is missing."

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **Azure Active Directory editions differ — Free, P1, and P2 each unlock different levels of security and management features.**
