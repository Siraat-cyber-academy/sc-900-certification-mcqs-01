# 🔐 Cybersecurity MCQ  

**Question Number 16**  

## 🌍 Scenario  
At **AstraNet Innovations**, the IT security team is configuring Azure **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** for tighter access control.  
One engineer asks:  

> “Can we use NSGs to filter traffic based on the **IP address, protocol, and port number**?”

## 📝 Options (Team Voices)  

A. 🇩🇰 **Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
“Yes… NSGs can be fine-tuned to filter by IP, protocol, and port — you just need to craft the right rules.”  

B. 🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
“Not really… NSGs are more about general allow/deny, not detailed filtering like IP and port specifics.”  

C. 🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
“It may seem possible, but NSGs only control inbound and outbound direction, not such granular fields.”  

D. 🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
“I think only firewalls can filter by IP, port, and protocol. NSGs don’t go that deep.”

## ✅ Correct Answer  
**Correct Option: A – Yes, NSGs can filter traffic based on IP address, protocol, and port number.**

## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)  

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
“Like a gatekeeper who not only decides *who enters*, but also checks *which road they came from, and which key they carry* — NSGs can filter by IP, port, and protocol. It is detail with discipline.”  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
“Exactly. NSGs allow admins to define security rules where conditions include **source/destination IP, protocol type (TCP/UDP), and port ranges**. That’s why A is correct.”  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
“Options B and C mislead. Many assume NSGs are too basic, but they *do* offer this level of filtering. Option D is a firewall trap — firewalls are stronger, yes, but NSGs already have IP/port/protocol rule capability.”  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
“Think of it like a nightclub with three checks:  
– Who are you (IP)?  
– How are you coming in (protocol)?  
– Which door do you want (port)?  
If you fail any, you’re not getting in!”  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
“This granularity helps protect users from unnecessary exposure — applying only the access truly needed, nothing more.”  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
“I thought NSGs were too simple. Now I see — they *can* filter based on IP, protocol, and port. That’s powerful!”  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary** *(risk born from neglect)*:  
“When ports are left open and IPs roam unchecked, I enter unseen.  
But when NSGs filter every detail, my shadows vanish at the threshold.”

## 🌟 Lesson  
👉 **NSGs are powerful enough to filter traffic based on IP, protocol, and port — making them a core defense layer in Azure networking.**
