## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Not every guiding light belongs to the same sky. Shared responsibility is a star of security, not of privacy. The true privacy constellations are control, transparency, and protection."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, Microsoft privacy principles include **Control, Transparency, Security, and Legal Protections**. The Shared Responsibility Model is about **cloud security roles** between provider and customer — not privacy."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Confusing privacy with shared responsibility is a trap. Attackers thrive when companies mistake operational duties for user rights."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of privacy principles as ingredients for baking a cake. Control, transparency, and security are the sugar, flour, and eggs. Shared responsibility? That’s like who does the dishes after the cake is baked!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"Privacy is about empowering users with rights. Shared responsibility is about assigning security tasks. Mixing them risks miscommunication and weaker trust."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I thought shared responsibility was a principle too — but now I get it! It’s about operations, not about the user’s right to privacy."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If DataSphere mistakes security models for privacy, they may neglect true privacy commitments — leaving users vulnerable to hidden exploitation."

## 🌟 Lesson
