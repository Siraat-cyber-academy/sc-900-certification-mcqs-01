# 📖 Story: The Mistaken Star  

**Question 03**

In the bustling town of **DataSphere Innovations**, the IT governance council gathered to prepare for their long-awaited journey into the skies of **Azure Cloud Services**.  

As they studied Microsoft’s privacy map, a young councilor raised his hand:  

> “Surely, the *Shared Responsibility Model* must be one of the guiding privacy principles — isn’t it about fairness and protection?”  

The room fell silent.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Characters  

- **Elder Yara**: Keeper of knowledge, separating truth from illusion.

## 🗣 Dialogue  

Farid pressed on:  
> “If security is shared, then isn’t that also privacy? They feel the same.”  

Elder Yara shook her head gently.  
> “Not every star belongs to the same constellation, Farid.  
> *Shared Responsibility* is the star of **cloud security** — it shows who guards which gate, provider or customer.  
> But privacy is a different constellation, with its own stars: **Control, Transparency, Security, and Legal Protections.**”  

From the dark corner, ShadowNet whispered:  
> “Confuse the two… blur the lines… and soon no one will notice when privacy is ignored.”  

Farid’s eyes widened. He realized he had been following the wrong star.

## 🌟 Truth Revealed  

The **Shared Responsibility Model** is **not** part of Microsoft’s privacy principles.  
- It defines the division of **security duties** between Microsoft (cloud provider) and the customer.  
- Microsoft’s **privacy principles** are about **user rights and trust**: Control, Transparency, Security, and Strong Legal Protections.  
- Mixing them up leads to blind spots where trust can be lost.

## 🌹 Lesson  

**Not every guiding light is a privacy principle — Shared Responsibility belongs to cloud security, not to privacy.**
