# 📖 Story: The Window of Transparency  

**Question 02**

In the bustling city of **NextWave Cloud Solutions**, leaders were preparing to move their treasure of records into the great skies — **Azure Cloud Services**.  

But before handing over the keys, a quiet voice in the council asked:  

> “Is *Transparency* truly one of Microsoft’s guiding privacy principles?  
> Or are we walking into clouds that hide more than they reveal?”

## 🗣 Dialogue  

Hamza leaned forward, his brow furrowed:  
> “If Microsoft doesn’t promise transparency, how do we trust what happens to our data?”  

Safiya smiled, opening a window in the council chamber so the morning sun streamed in.  
> “Hamza, transparency is like sunlight.  
> It shows you what lies within the room, leaving no corner for shadows to hide.  
> Without it, promises turn hollow.”  

From the darkness, ShadowNet hissed:  
> “If you remove transparency, I will rule in secrecy.  
> Users will never know what is done with their data — and I will twist silence into power.”  

Hamza’s eyes widened, but then softened as the sunlight fell on his hands.

## 🌟 Truth Revealed  

Microsoft’s privacy framework rests on key pillars: **Control, Transparency, Security, and Legal Protections**.  
- Transparency means users know **what data is collected**, **how it is used**, and **why it is needed**.  
- It builds confidence that systems are honest, not hidden.  
- Without transparency, even the strongest security feels like a locked box with no key.

## 🌹 Lesson  

**Transparency is the open window of privacy — sunlight builds trust, shadows breed doubt.**
