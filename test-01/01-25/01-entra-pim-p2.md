## 📝 Options (Team Voices)  

A. 🇩🇰 **Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
"Maybe the free edition could do it? It feels simple enough, but does it really offer such advanced protection?"  

B. 🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
"Could it be the **External ID** edition? It focuses on outside users, but does it really handle privileged role management inside the company?"  

C. 🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"The **P1 edition** does add important identity security features. But does it reach the deeper level of control needed for managing elevated admin access?"  

D. 🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"Isn’t **P2** the one with the big guns — the advanced identity governance and PIM included?"

## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)  

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Like a fortress that only opens its hidden gates for the worthy, PIM rests within the higher walls of **P2**. The soul of identity governance finds its full expression there — guarding power with wisdom and restraint."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, PIM is not available in Free, External ID, or P1. You need **Microsoft Entra ID P2**, because it includes Privileged Identity Management. P1 focuses on Conditional Access and MFA, but PIM demands advanced governance that only P2 provides."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"The wrong answers fail because they either don’t have advanced governance (Free), serve external guests not internal admins (External ID), or stop short of role-based privileged lifecycle controls (P1). Only P2 unlocks the gates to PIM."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it like a theme park pass. Free is just the entrance gate, External ID is for visitors only, P1 lets you ride some cool attractions — but P2? That’s the VIP wristband for the rollercoaster of admin control!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"This matters for people, not just systems. Without PIM, admins might keep permanent high privileges, which increases risks. P2 ensures elevated access is temporary, approved, and monitored — keeping both staff and data safe."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"At first, I thought maybe P1 was enough… but now I get it. To actually *control* who becomes admin and when, you need the **P2 level**. That’s where PIM lives."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"Choose wrongly, and admin accounts remain doors left ajar. Without PIM, my kind walks freely in shadows, waiting for one careless permanent privilege to slip open the vault."
