**Question 01**

## 📝 Options (Team Voices)

A. 🇩🇰 **Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
"Maybe it works with the free edition — but that feels too easy, doesn’t it?"  

B. 🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
"Perhaps External ID could help, but it’s designed for guest users, not internal privilege control."  

C. 🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"With P1, you gain conditional access and identity protection, but sadly, PIM isn’t part of this tier."  

D. 🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"So P2 is the real one — it unlocks PIM and advanced security. This must be it, right?"

## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"Like a gate that only opens to the worthy, PIM resides in the higher realm of P2. The seeker of balance finds strength here, where power is borrowed, never possessed eternally."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, Microsoft only includes PIM in **Entra ID P2**, because it offers just-in-time privileged role activation, access reviews, and risk-based controls. Lower editions simply don’t have this governance depth."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Free? Too weak. External ID? Misaligned purpose. P1? Better security, yes — but no PIM. Only P2 equips admins with the ability to rein in privilege sprawl."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of PIM like a VIP lounge. Free users peek through the window, P1 gets you into the building, but only P2 hands you the golden wristband."  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"When humans hold standing privileges too long, mistakes happen. P2 ensures admins get access only when they truly need it — reducing human error and insider risk."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I thought P1 would be enough — I mean, it already has cool features! But now I see P2 is the big boss level where PIM actually lives."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If SkyShield chose wrong, privileged accounts would stand wide open. I would lurk in the shadows, waiting for a forgotten admin token to fall into my grasp…"

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **Microsoft Entra ID P2 is the only edition that unlocks Privileged Identity Management — the true shield against standing admin risks.**
