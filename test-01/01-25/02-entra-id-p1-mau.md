## 📝 Options (Team Voices)

A. 🇩🇰 **Eks2 – The Curious Whisper**:  
"Maybe the free edition is enough? It gives basic identity features, but does it really cover MAU billing?"  

B. 🇪🇸 **Sofia Zaymera – The Calm Guardian**:  
"External ID sounds tempting since it mentions external users, but its billing doesn’t include the first 50,000 free MAUs."  

C. 🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"P1 gives more enterprise-level identity controls and it’s the **minimum edition** that covers the free 50,000 MAUs under billing."  

D. 🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"P2 is more advanced — it surely works, but maybe it’s more than what’s actually required here."

## 💬 Team Discussion (Explanations)

🇵🇰 **I.K. – The Unseen Mentor**:  
"To walk the path of balance, one need not always climb the highest mountain. P1 is the threshold where generosity flows — the first 50,000 souls pass freely, unburdened by cost."  

🇷🇺 **Elina Petrova – The Cloud Whiz**:  
"Technically, both **P1 and P2 support MAU billing with the first 50,000 free**, but P1 is the minimum requirement. Free and External ID editions don’t grant that benefit — they charge per user immediately."  

🇪🇸 **Inky Rihan – The Phantom**:  
"Free edition? Too limited, no free MAU benefit. External ID? Sounds right but traps you with hidden billing. P2? Correct but overkill. P1 hits the sweet spot — cost-efficient and functional."  

🇩🇰 **Kasper Madsen – The Joyful Specialist**:  
"Think of it like an amusement park. Free gets you to the parking lot, External ID hands you the wrong ticket, P1 gets you through the gates with free rides for the first 50,000 friends, and P2 gives you VIP fast passes you might not need!"  

🇮🇹 **Isabella Konti – The Empathic Firewall**:  
"This ensures organizations don’t overspend when opening access to partners. By using P1, companies can build trust while staying financially safe."  

🇨🇳 **Maya Lin – The Rookie**:  
"I thought P2 was the only way — but now I get it: P1 already unlocks the 50,000 free MAUs. P2 is like the deluxe upgrade, not the entry ticket."  

🕶️ **ShadowNet – The Phantom Adversary**:  
"If BlueWave picked wrong, unexpected costs would bleed into budgets. And in financial chaos, security cracks often widen…"

## 🌟 Lesson
👉 **Microsoft Entra ID P1 is the minimum edition that grants 50,000 free MAUs under billing — balancing cost and capability.**
